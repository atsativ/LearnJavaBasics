There are 3 ways to run JS:

1. FROM THE BROWSER 
    + Create a normal html page 
    + Open the dev tools 
    + Cllick on console in the side bar 
    + type out your js code there 
    
    - Cannot possibly type out all code in the console
    - It is for temporary purpose only 

2. INLINE JS 
    + use a script tag inside of the body tag in your html page
    + wrie all js there
    
    - usually not considered as the best practice
    - code gets too big to debug

3. EXTERNAL JS

    + Create a seperate js file with the extension of .js
    + where you have called the script tag add a parameter/ attribute called source (src)
    + Example : 
            <script src="main.js"></script>



Note :

In the index.html page (Please refer code ) :

-- line no 9 does not execute any longer since the src arg is used in the script tag
